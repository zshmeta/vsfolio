# VSFolio

## Description

This is my first attempt to a proper pro grade portfolio. I have decided to use industry leading stacks such as React, Vite or Storybooks. The aim was both to design and deploy a great looking portfolio, but also to practice and show what the architecture of a modern, entreprise grade and highly scalable web app looks like.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- Yarn
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zshmeta/vsfolio.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the app

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Usage

### Development

In case you wish to have a look at the code and play around with the project, you can run the `yarn dev` command to start the app in dev mode.

Once done coding and testing, you can run the `yarn build` command to build the app for production.

### Production

In case you wish to have a look at the app in production, you can run the `yarn serve` command to start the app in production mode. There are otherwise many ways to get it online such as:

- Deploying it on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure or GCP
- Deploying it on a serverless platform such as Vercel, Netlify or Heroku
- Deploying it on a container platform such as Docker or Kubernetes

## Conclusion

There is no need to set the rules for contributing as this is a personal project. However, if you wish to contribute, you can always fork the repo and submit a pull request. I will be more than happy to review it and merge it if it fits the project.
